# Code Structure

## âš¡ Quick Reference

### **Most Used Packages**

- **`analytics-js-common`** - Shared utilities and types
- **`analytics-js-plugins`** - Plugin implementations
- **`analytics-js`** - Main SDK for browsers

### **Common Utilities** (from `analytics-js-common`)

- `removeUndefinedAndNullValues()` - Clean objects
- `isNonEmptyObject()` - Object validation
- `mergeDeepRight()` - Deep merge objects (Ramda)
- `clone()` - Deep clone objects (Ramda)

### **Key Directories**

```
packages/analytics-js-plugins/src/        # Plugin source code
packages/analytics-js-common/src/types/   # Shared TypeScript types
packages/analytics-js-common/src/utilities/ # Helper functions
```

This monorepo contains multiple packages, each serving a distinct role in the RudderStack JavaScript SDK ecosystem. Below is an overview of the main packages and their responsibilities.

## Implementation Patterns & Best Practices

### Utility Reuse

- **Preference for Existing Utilities**: Always leverage existing utilities from `analytics-js-common/utilities` instead of creating custom implementations
- **Example**: Use `removeUndefinedAndNullValues()` for object cleanup rather than manual property deletion loops
- **Common Utilities**: `isNonEmptyObject()`, `removeUndefinedAndNullValues()`, `mergeDeepRight()`, `clone()` from Ramda

### Code Style

- **Concise Solutions**: Favor readable, concise implementations over verbose custom helper functions
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function should have a clear, single purpose
- **Minimal Code Changes**: Only modify sections related to the task at hand, avoid unnecessary refactoring

## Package Descriptions

### `analytics-js`

- **Purpose:** The main JavaScript SDK for tracking events in browsers.
- **Exports:** Modern, bundled, and legacy builds for different browser environments.
- **Usage:** For websites, SPAs, and Chrome Extensions (content scripts).
- **Build Output:** `dist/` folder with CDN and NPM builds.

### `analytics-js-service-worker`

- **Purpose:** SDK for use in service workers, browser extensions (background scripts), and serverless runtimes.
- **Exports:** Service worker-compatible analytics client.
- **Usage:** Chrome Extensions (background), Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, etc.

### `analytics-js-plugins`

- **Purpose:** Optional plugins for the JS SDK, loaded dynamically or bundled.
- **Usage:** Extend SDK features on demand (see [plugin docs](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#plugins)).

### `analytics-js-integrations`

- **Purpose:** Device mode integrations for third-party destinations.
- **Usage:** Bundled or loaded as needed to support direct client-side integrations.
- **Structure:** Each integration has its own directory with `constants.js`, integration logic, and tests.
- **Constants Pattern:** Each integration exports `NAME`, `DISPLAY_NAME`, `DIR_NAME`, and integration-specific constants.

### `analytics-js-cookies`

- **Purpose:** Cookie utilities for browser and Node.js environments.
- **Exports:** Functions for reading/decrypting RudderStack cookies, with support for both browser and Node.js.

### `analytics-js-common`

- **Purpose:** Shared code and utilities used by other SDK packages (analytics, plugins, integrations, service worker).

### `analytics-js-legacy-utilities`

- **Purpose:** Shared utilities for common code between integrations and analytics-v1.1 packages.
- **Package Name:** `@rudderstack/analytics-js-legacy-utilities`
- **Status:** Active package with complete NX setup (package.json, project.json, TypeScript configs, tests, etc.).

### `sanity-suite`

- **Purpose:** Sanity suite for manual and automated testing of the SDK.
- **Usage:** Used with the RudderStack client-side test framework.
- **Structure:**
  - `public/` - Static HTML files for different test scenarios
  - `public/all/index.html` - **Aggregator page** that embeds all sanity suites in iframes
  - Supports multiple SDK versions (V3, V1.1) and distribution types (CDN, NPM)

### `loading-scripts`

- **Purpose:** Loading script snippets for initializing the SDK in various environments.

### `analytics-v1.1`

- **Purpose:** Deprecated legacy SDK. Only present for migration and backward compatibility.
- **Note:** New projects should use `analytics-js`.

## Notes

- All packages are written in TypeScript except for `analytics-v1.1` and `analytics-js-integrations`.
- Builds are output to each package's `dist/` directory.
- Shared utilities are factored into `analytics-js-common` to avoid duplication.
- The monorepo is managed with Nx (see `nx.json` in the root).
- For more details on each package, see the respective `README.md` in each package directory.
