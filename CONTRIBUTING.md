## Adding your own integrations

One way you can contribute to this project is by adding integrations of your choice for sending the data through their respective web (JavaScript) SDKs.

### How to build the SDK

- Look for run scripts in the `package.json` file for getting the browser minified and non-minified builds. The builds are updated in the `dist` folder of the directory. Among the others, some of the important ones are:

  - `npm run build:browser`: This outputs **rudder-analytics.min.js**.
  - `npm run build:npm`: This outputs **rudder-sdk-js** folder that contains the npm package contents.
  - `npm run build:integration:all`: This outputs **integrations** folder that contains the integrations.

> We use **rollup** to build our SDKs. The configurations for them are present in `rollup-configs` folder.

- For adding or removing integrations, modify the imports in `index.js` under the `src/integrations` folder.

## Committing

We prefer squash or rebase commits so that all changes from a branch are committed to master as a single commit. All pull requests are squashed when merged, but rebasing prior to merge gives you better control over the commit message.

## Installing and setting up RudderStack

To contribute to this project, you may need to install RudderStack on your machine. You can do so by following our [**docs**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack) and set up RudderStack in no time.
